## REST API with flask on Python
Course project for the course "Signaling Systems and Protocols [RAE553]"

### Description
------------
In present project we are going to learn how to build REST API using `$flask` library in Python. Make sure all the prerequisites are done and the necessary packages are installed to avoid technical issues with OS and/or software. You can use any code editor on your choice: VSCode or Atom. Project covers the following topics:

* Creating basic flask-RESTful application;
* Training with API design;
* Creating Resources;
* ItemList;
* Authentication and logging;
* Resource storage in SQL database. 

### Prerequisites
1. Linux (any distribution of your choice, but Ubuntu is preferable) operating system or Mac OS 
2. VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Atom (https://atom.io/) --> `$ sudo snap install atom --classic`
4. Flask restful package (`$ pip install flask-restful`)
5. Postman platform for API development: (https://www.getpostman.com/ )
6. Curl (https://curl.haxx.se/)

Note: If the latest version of Ubuntu is used, you can install Postman through Ubuntu Software Center (just search for the relevant application and press Install button).

### Setting up working environment
------------
1. Create a virtual environment (if not yet done) using anaconda or miniconda: `$ conda create -n environment_name`
2. Switch to this virtual environment: `$ source activate environment_name`;
3. Inside virtual environment, create a new folder for your project `$ mkdir project folder`;
4. Change directory to the newly created project folder;
5. Launch Atom using `$ atom . ` command in terminal (works for Linux and MacOS);
6. Command for cloning a single branch: `$ git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>`.
